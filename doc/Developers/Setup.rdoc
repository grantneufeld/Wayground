The roodi gem may not run properly depending on your configuration. You may need to fix the `gems/roodi-*/roodi.yml` file by converting lines that look like:
  ClassLineCountCheck: { line_count: 300 }
to:
  ClassLineCountCheck:
    line_count: 300

Iâ€™ve included a file here (`doc/Developers/roodi.yml`) that works with rood-2.1.0 on my setup.
