= Testing the code

These are instructions for testing the code, and guidelines for writing tests.

Rspec is being used for unit tests. Cucumber for behavioural/feature tests. The Cucumber features are the priority for testing.

I am not using Rspec or TestUnit based integration testing, because that functionality is effectively covered using Cucumber feature testing.


== Autotest

While working on the code, you can have autotest continuously running in a terminal to alert you when a change you make causes a test to fail.

> bundle exec autotest


== Cucumber

The Cucumber features are the most critical piece of testing; code should not be written without being fully covered by Cucumber feature scripts (always run “rake cucumber:rcov” before committing code to ensure 100% code coverage).

To run the cucumber feature scenarios:
> rake cucumber

There are two special tags to be used when writing feature scenarios. Tags are put on the line before a “Scenario:”, or on the first line of the feature file (to apply to all scenarios in the file).
* ‘@future’: Have the scenario(s) ignored completely when running cucumber. This allows for using the feature files to describe future features in context (a sort of “to-do” list).
* ‘@wip’: Work in progress. These are for the scenarios you are currently working on (in general, there should be no more than 3 of these active at a time). These scenarios will not run during the normal cucumber execution, since they are expected to fail (being incomplete). You can run just the @wip scenarios while your work is in progress:
> rake cucumber:wip


== Rcov

These are the rake commands available for running rcov testing (use rake instead of calling rcov directly):

Complete coverage:
> rake rcov

Coverage provided by just the Cucumber features:
> rake cucumber:rcov

Coverage provided by just the Rspec specs:
> rake spec:rcov

Coverage reports can be reviewed in coverage/index.html


== Unit Testing With Rspec

There’s a tiny bit of testing code written using rspec (the test files are in the spec directory). Ideally, comprehensive unit tests should be written in rspec for at least all model classes and any utility libraries.

To run the unit tests:
> rake spec


== Code Quality Testing

The rails-best-practices gem can be used to try to spot some sub-optimal coding.
> sudo gem install rails_best_practices

Then run it within the project directory:
> rails_best_practices .
