  Scenario: User signs out
    Given I am signed up and confirmed as "test+email@wayground.ca/password"
    When I sign in as "test+email@wayground.ca/password"
    Then I should be signed in
    And I sign out
    Then I should see "Signed out"
    Then I should be signed out
    When I return next time
    Then I should be signed out
